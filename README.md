- Hi, I’m @fluffystat. I programmed in C, C++, and Python in undergrad, but I forgot a lot of it. Now I'm learning web development. My main goal is to become a szuper h@(k3r and take over the world. After that I will assist Elon with the creation of catgirl cyborgs, as I also have skills in genetics.
